For each suggest also suggest the code change.

## Modularity & Single Responsibility

- Each file and function should have a single, well-defined purpose.
- Avoid mixing unrelated logic in the same module.

## Code quality

- Ensure code is clean and readable.
- Remove commented-out or dead code.
- Avoid magic numbers and hard-coded values; use constants where appropriate. Suggest the change if apply.
- We use Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide specifically for event handlers.
- Avoid any type of debugging with `console`. If found, suggest removing it.
- Avoid repetitive code by extracting common logic into reusable functions, helpers, or shared setup blocks to ensure maintainability and adherence to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Use KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) principle where appropriate.
- When using HTML syntax, ensure proper indentation, semantic tags, and accessibility best practices (such as using alt attributes for images and appropriate ARIA roles).
- Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and files. Suggest the changed where appropriate.
